============

The ORFEO Toolbox is a project conducted by CNES and developed in
cooperation with CS (Communication & Systèmes), http://www.c-s.fr.

This Software Guide is based on the ITK Software Guide: the build
process for the documentation, many examples and even the LaTeX   
sources were taken from ITK. We are very grateful to the ITK developpers
and contributors and especially to Luis Ibáñez.

The OTB specifics were implemented and documented by the OTB Development
Team with some help from several contributors, without these
people [1]_, OTB will not be where it is today:

Contributions from users are expected and encouraged for the comming
versions of OTB.
